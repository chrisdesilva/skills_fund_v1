        <p>
          We may also request your permission to share your Personal Information

        </p>
        <h2>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>
          We employ reasonable security measures, designed to maintain the
          confidentiality and security of your Personal Information to protect
          against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have
          collected from you through the Online Services. For example, Skills
          Fund employs policies and procedures to designed to protect Personal
          Information in accordance with applicable law, including but not
          limited to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Unfortunately, no security
          technology is completely secure, and you should remember that email
          and the Internet generally may not be a secure means of communication
          and/or transmitting Personal Information. Personal Information that
          you share via email is done so at your own risk.
        </p>
        <h2>Do We Track Our Visitors Online?</h2>
        <p>
          Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" or similar signals to
          the websites with which a user communicates. There currently is no
          industry standard for how websites must respond when they receive such
          a signal. The Online Services do not respond to do-not-track signals
          sent by web browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the content, advertisements, and functionality on the Online
          Services may be provided by third parties. We also use third-party
          service providers to provide us with analytics services so we can
          improve the Online Services. These third parties may collect
          information about your use of the Online Services through technologies
          such as cookies and web beacons, and this information may be collected
          over time and combined with information collected across different
          websites. These third parties will only collect Personal Information
          if you provide it directly to them. Some of these third parties may
          provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected
          or used for targeted advertising. For example, some of these third
          parties may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI")
          or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), which provide websites
          where you can opt out of certain types of data collection and use or
          out of receiving targeted ads from member companies. To opt out,
          please visit{" "}

          One of the third-party services that we use is Google Analytics, which
          is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google utilizes the data
          collected to track and examine the use of the Online Services and may
          share this data with other Google services. We have also enabled
          Google Analytics Advertising features, including Remarketing, so
          Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the
          ads of its own advertising networks. The Online Services and third
          parties, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google
          Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick
          cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past
          visits to the Online Services and report how ad impressions, other
          uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad
          services are related to visits to the Online Services. You can learn
          more about Google’s privacy practices by visiting their website at{" "}

          policies than the Online Services. Please review the privacy policy of
          any website you access through the Online Services as any information
          that you share with third-party websites are not subject to this
